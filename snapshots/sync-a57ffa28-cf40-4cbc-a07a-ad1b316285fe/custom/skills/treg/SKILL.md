## First, check which treg you have

This bundle ships two things: the page you are reading, and a treg MCP connector that stays
**disabled until `TREG_TOKEN` is in dsh's environment** — a connector registered without a token is
MCP tools that return 401 on every call. So the first move depends on which one you got.

**If you can see `mcp__treg__catalog_search`, `mcp__treg__catalog_get`, `mcp__treg__call`,
`mcp__treg__balance` and `mcp__treg__my_tools`** — the token was there at boot and there is nothing
to install. The rest of this page is written around the `treg` command line, so read
`treg catalog search` as `mcp__treg__catalog_search`, `treg call` as `mcp__treg__call`, and so on.

**If you cannot see them**, this profile booted without a token. Everything here still works through
the CLI, which you set up once:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://treg.to/install.sh | sh   # the CLI, pointed at treg
treg login                                   # sign in; first login registers you
```

A new team starts with **$1.00 of free balance**, so there is nothing to pay before the first call.
If sign-in is needed, say so plainly and stop — never ask the human for a provider's API key, which
is the thing treg exists to avoid.

To get the tools as well, the human exports that token in the environment dsh starts in and
**restarts dsh** — the row is then enabled automatically:

```bash
export TREG_TOKEN=<token from https://treg.to → sign in → copy token>
```

Do **not** run `treg mcp install` for this: it writes configs for Claude Code, Cursor and opencode,
and a dsh profile is neither. This bundle already carries the dsh row.

One more thing worth mentioning to the human rather than silently fixing: `install.sh` always runs
`treg skill bootstrap`, which drops a second copy of this same page into `~/.agents/skills/treg/` —
a directory dsh also scans. Harmless, but redundant with this bundle.

# treg — the tool catalog for your agent

**Ask for the task, not the tool.** When a job needs external or live data — backlinks, keyword
volume, a TikTok profile, a work email, competitor ad creative — search the catalog, read the price,
call it.

Two kinds of tool answer to the same token, through the same proxy, which injects the credential
**server-side** so you never hold it:

- **The catalog** — curated external endpoints treg can call for you.
- **Your own tools** — what a teammate registered and shared with this org: API accounts, OAuth
  connections, skills.
  Note: an X (Twitter) connection made through treg's app is metered per call (X bills the app
  owner per use); the response reports the price. A team's own X developer app is not metered.

The mechanics:

- **Endpoint:** `https://treg.to`  ·  **CLI:** `treg`  ·  the CLI is a thin client over the API.
- **Auth:** every call sends `X-Treg-Token: <your token>`.
- A **tool** = an upstream base URL + credential **bindings**. A **skill/bundle** = a recipe
  (SKILL.md) + its secrets + its tool(s). The proxy *relays, never models* the upstream.

New verified accounts receive $1.00 of signup credit once, when creating an eligible team.
Additional teams start with no signup credit. Legacy `POST /users` registration does not verify
an email or grant credit; use email OTP or Google/GitHub sign-in. Existing balances remain usable.

## First: install + sign in
```bash
curl -fsSL https://treg.to/install.sh | sh     # installs the CLI + points it here
treg login                            # browser sign-in (GitHub / Google / email code) — first login registers you
treg login --email you@company.com    # terminal-only alternative (emailed 6-digit code)
treg login --token <per-org-token>    # non-interactive (agents/CI)
```
Everything runs in your **active org** (after first login, create or join a team). Team invites arrive by
email — see them with `treg invites`, accept with `treg accept` (or `treg org join <code>`). Switch
teams: `treg org switch <slug>`.

## Already connected over MCP? Then you have the tools, not the CLI

If you reached treg through `https://treg.to/mcp/` — ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor — the CLI steps above do not
apply to you. You have `catalog_search`, `catalog_get`, `call`, `call_media`, `resources_list`,
`balance`, `my_tools`, `catalog_request`, `feedback`, and `review`.
Everything in this document maps onto them:

- "search the catalog" → `catalog_search`, then `catalog_get` for the exact price and parameters.
  Its `verdict` says what you got: `strong` (these do the job, every provider of it by measured
  success), `closest` (nearest, check `catalog_get`), `none` (not in the catalog: file
  `catalog_request`, do not rephrase), `keyword` (ranked by words alone)
- "call it" → `call` with the endpoint id, or `<tool-name>/<path>` for one of the team's own tools
- "check the balance" → `balance`
- "share feedback" → `feedback`

The rules below are the same either way. The one that matters most — **say the price before you
spend it** — matters more here, because `call` returns `cost_usd` and you can report what a call
actually cost rather than estimating.

A `call` on a catalog endpoint spends the team's balance. A `call` on one of the team's own tools
spends nothing: that key belongs to them.

## Task — the catalog: what treg can do for you (start here)

3,800+ catalogued endpoints across 109 providers, grouped by what they DO: keyword & rank tracking,
backlinks & authority, AI visibility, trending & discovery, publishing to the team's own social
accounts, people & company enrichment, ads management & creative, measurement, video & image
generation.

```bash
treg catalog search "subreddit posts"            # find endpoints by what they do
treg catalog get scrapecreators.reddit.subreddit.posts   # params, PRICE, how you'd be served
treg call scrapecreators.reddit.subreddit.posts --query subreddit=news
treg balance                                     # the prepaid balance + recent charges
treg catalog request "<what you need>"           # searched, not there? file it — steers what's added next
```
Notes:
- Every endpoint's price is in `treg catalog get`, before you call it.
- Search for the job AND any output you need: `treg catalog search "email verification catch-all"`
  finds different tools from a broad email-verification search. Check each candidate with
  `treg catalog get` for its fields, parameters and price before choosing. If you need a provider's
  catch-all, disposable, role-address or SMTP field, call that provider's endpoint: the routed
  `treg.people.email.verify` contract defines only `valid`, `status` and `score`.
- A catalog endpoint can use a verified public route with no provider key. Such a call is free when
  the caller does not send a provider credential. The team tool or stored provider key still wins.
- Discovery jobs usually have TWO shapes in the catalog — a structured one (filters: title, location,
  followers, funding) and a semantic one (describe what you want; `exa.*`). When a brief mixes hard
  limits with a fuzzy niche, run both and merge: e.g. creators = `influencersclub.creators.search`
  (filters) ∪ `exa.creators.search` (description, pinned to the platform domain); people = a
  `people.search` provider ∪ `exa.people.search`; who-holds-a-role questions = `exa.web.answer`.
- HTTP **402** = out of balance, with a machine-actionable body (`balance_micro`,
  `estimated_cost_micro`, `topup_url`). Recovery: `treg balance` → top up in the dashboard
  (Team → Billing) → or store the org's own key for that provider (own keys are never billed
  to the balance — they take priority automatically). A 402 with `error: route_max_cost` is
  different: YOUR `X-Treg-Route-Max-Cost` header refused the call before anything was charged —
  ask for fewer rows/targets or raise the ceiling.
- **Scripting many calls:** use `treg --json call …`. Stdout is one line,
  `{"result": <provider body>, "_treg": {"http_status", "call_id", "charged_micro"}}`, and nothing
  goes to stderr, so a script that merges the streams still parses every answer (`--await` output
  is unchanged). Run a handful and check the parsed results before looping over the whole list: a
  parse bug throws away answers that were already billed.
- The real charge is the response header `X-Treg-Cost-Micro` (micro-USD), with `X-Treg-Call-Id`
  as the id to quote. An idempotent replay reports `0` there and the first call's charge in
  `X-Treg-Original-Cost-Micro`. Lost an answer you paid for? `GET /calls/<call id>/result`
  returns the stored response of a successful catalog call. On an asynchronous submission that header is the reserved ceiling; the CLI
  labels it as a reservation, and the terminal task settles the real charge. The catalog `~$/call`
  figure for a `per_result` route assumes a 20-row page
  when the price is per row; when the catalog `cost.unit` is `target`/`domain`/`keyword` you pay
  per thing asked about, one unit per target. Failed calls (4xx/5xx relayed from the provider)
  are free; empty results mean whatever the provider means by them — treg relays, it does not
  normalise.
- A call may be answered from treg's archive of the exact same question while that answer is
  fresh: verbatim provider bytes, `X-Treg-Cache: hit`, `X-Treg-Fetched-At`, `X-Treg-Age`. Your
  team's first call on a question costs full price either way; from your second call on, a hit
  costs 10%, and a hit on your own key is free. `Cache-Control: no-cache` forces a live call;
  `X-Treg-Max-Age: <seconds>` accepts only a younger answer.
- HTTP **503** `provider_capacity_unavailable` = treg's own account for that provider is out
  (not your balance; nothing charged). Body has `resets_at` and `alternatives` (same capability,
  other providers) — choose one, or use your own key. treg never switches providers for you.
  treg re-checks the provider about once a minute, so a retry after a minute can succeed.
- An org tool or secret for the provider always wins over an anonymous route or treg's key,
  automatically — the catalog is the fallback, not a replacement for keys the team already has.
- **Choosing between providers of one capability — the procedure.** `treg catalog get <id>` lists
  every provider serving the same job with `COST`, `WORKS` (success rate treg has observed, with the
  sample size), `SPEED` (median) and `LAST OK`. Work down this order:
  1. **Match the inputs you actually HAVE.** An endpoint wanting a `profile_url` is not a substitute
     when you hold a name and a domain, whatever it costs. This rule outranks price every time.
  2. Then **reliability**: a high `WORKS` with a real sample beats a rounder number with a tiny one —
     `99% (121)` is stronger evidence than `100% (8)`.
  3. Then **price**. Spreads inside one capability reach 200×, so this is usually where the money is.
  4. `LAST OK` breaks ties. A bare age means a real call came back; a **`✓` age is the catalog's own
     verification stamp, not live traffic**; `—` means nobody has verified it and nobody has called
     it — prefer almost anything else.
  - **If a call fails with 429 / 5xx / a timeout, try the next provider.** You know its parameters,
    so you can build its request. Say which one you switched to.
  - **Never retry a 4xx elsewhere.** A 4xx is usually your parameters; fixing them is the fix, and
    retrying burns the team's money on N providers for one mistake.
  - treg does **not** choose or fail over **between providers** for you. That is deliberate: only
    you know which inputs you hold, and treg relays rather than rewrites your request. If treg's
    own account for a provider is out it may serve the **same endpoint** through a treg-owned relay
    (`X-Treg-Served-Via: overflow:<name>`, or `served_via` + a hint on the MCP `call` result; real
    price, same shape). `catalog_get` shows that price up front as `overflow_price_usd` when the
    deployment can relay the endpoint - a "free" endpoint with one may bill exactly that, so quote
    it. A team opts out with `treg org overflow off`.
  - **Routed endpoints** (`treg.<capability>`, e.g. `treg.people.email.find`) are where you can
    ask treg to choose: POST the identity (`{full_name, domain}` | `{first_name, last_name, domain}` |
    `{linkedin_url}`); treg runs the best child (own keys first, then cheapest per hit), falls back
    on errors AND misses (cheapest first, within `X-Treg-Route-Max-Cost`, default $1; a miss can be
    billed, so a routed row quotes `usd_per_call: null`, not $0 — set the header for bulk runs), and returns
    `{output, raw, _treg.served_by, _treg.tried}` + `X-Treg-Served-By`. `X-Treg-Route-Waterfall: 0`
    stops at the first miss. A filter a provider cannot apply (`country` on a name-only search) is
    still sent to the others, and the answer names it in `X-Treg-Ignored-Filters` / `_treg.ignored_filters`
    — post-filter, or send `X-Treg-Route-Strict-Filters: 1` to get a 422 (unbilled) instead of a looser
    answer. `catalog_get treg.people.email.find` shows the plan and prices.
    An async child is submitted and polled internally for up to 60 seconds. If it is still running,
    treg returns HTTP 202 with `_treg.outcome: pending`, its call reference and poll descriptor,
    `reserved_micro`, and `charged_micro: null`; do not retry or start another provider, because the
    existing task may still complete and charge.
  - **A found contact is not a confirmed one.** An email or phone find returns the provider's best
    match; only `output.verified: true` means it checked the mailbox. When it is not, the answer
    carries `_treg.advice` naming the verify step (`treg.people.email.verify`, a fraction of a cent)
    — run it before outreach, and never re-send the same find: every hit bills, repeats included.
  - **Verify before you send. Every address, every time.** This includes rows from a company or
    domain search (`treg.people.search`, `hunter.companies.emails`, …): those are directory
    listings, and a row's email is unconfirmed unless that row's own verification field says
    otherwise. Treat `invalid` as dead and `accept_all` as risky. And never send to an address the
    provider did not return — if a domain search came back empty, `info@` is a guess, not a result.
    Live 2026-09-08: 73 of one team's 79 bounces were unverified rows and guesses that one $0.006
    verify call each would have caught.
- An endpoint with no published price is refused rather than served free; connect your own key.

## Task - generate video, images, voice, or music

Generation models live in the catalog under the `video-gen`, `image-gen`, `voice-gen`, and `music-gen` platforms,
one row per model per route, so the same model on two routes sits next to itself with both prices.
Models are not interchangeable - you pick one; treg does not choose.

```bash
treg catalog search "text to video"                  # every model, with prices
treg catalog get minimax.video-gen.h3.generate       # native params, model enum, price table, async descriptor
treg call minimax.video-gen.h3.generate --await --timeout 900 --data '{"model":"MiniMax-H3-Max",
  "content":[{"type":"text","text":"A paper boat drifts across a quiet pond at sunrise."}],
  "resolution":"480P","duration":5,"ratio":"16:9"}'
treg call minimax.voice-gen.voices.list --data '{"voice_type":"system"}'
treg catalog get minimax.voice-gen.speech-2-8-turbo
treg call minimax.voice-gen.speech-2-8-turbo --data '{"model":"speech-2.8-turbo",
  "text":"A calm voice can make a complex idea feel simple.","stream":false,"output_format":"url",
  "voice_setting":{"voice_id":"English_expressive_narrator","speed":1,"vol":1,"pitch":0}}'
```
How it works:
- **Voice generation is synchronous.** MiniMax returns JSON containing a 24-hour audio URL. The
  catalog route fixes `stream:false` and `output_format:"url"`; use the voice-list action to discover
  valid system voice IDs, then choose HD or Turbo by endpoint id.
- **Fish Audio is binary and team-scoped on the platform key.** Use
  `fishaudio.tts.s2-1-pro` with header `model: s2.1-pro`; redirect CLI stdout to an audio file or use
  MCP `call_media`. To use a Fish-supplied voice, call `fishaudio.voices.discover` with
  `self=false` and `licensed=true|false`, then pass a returned `_id` as `reference_id`; `true`
  selects Fish's rights-secured subset and `false` includes public/community voices. treg rechecks
  that non-team id as public before platform-key synthesis. Create reusable
  private voices with `fishaudio.voices.create`, then list their ids with
  `treg resources list --provider fishaudio --kind voice` or MCP `resources_list`. Those list the
  connected Fish account under BYOK and otherwise list only the current team's platform voices; curl uses
  `GET /orgs/{org_id}/provider-resources?provider=fishaudio&kind=voice`. BYOK remains an unrestricted
  unmetered relay. `treg resources list` requires CLI ≥ 0.21.0; run `treg update` if the
  `resources` command is unrecognised.
- **A video or image generation call is an async task.** The submission returns a task id at once; `--await` polls
  the provider until it finishes and prints the **final response only** on stdout. stderr carries the
  task id, a resumable `treg call …` command (Ctrl-C loses the wait, never the task or the money),
  progress, and the result URL. Exit 0 = done, 2 = the provider failed the task, 3 = timed out
  (resume with the printed command).
- **Reference media (a face image, a voice clip, a first frame) must be a public URL the vendor
  can fetch.** Do not reach for a paste host: they fail vendor probes at random (catbox, tmpfiles,
  uguu all did). `treg host face.jpg` prints a public URL (30 MB, 7 days, free) that drops straight
  into `image_urls` / `audio_urls`: `--data "{\"image_urls\":[\"$(treg host face.jpg)\"], …}"`.
  Requires CLI ≥ 0.20.0; run `treg update` if `treg host` is unrecognised.
- **CLI agents: raise your shell tool's timeout or run the call in the background.** A video takes
  1-5 minutes; a runtime's default 2-minute command limit cuts it off mid-wait.
- **MCP and raw-HTTP agents:** the response header `X-Treg-Async` is the descriptor - where to poll,
  which status values are terminal, where the result is. Poll lazily: wait ~60 s before the first
  check, then every 30-60 s; three to six checks per video is normal. Do other work in between.
- Parameters are the provider's own, verbatim; `treg catalog get` shows them, including the
  enum of selectable models and resolutions. Nothing is translated between providers.
- **Money:** the price is reserved at submission and charged only when the task succeeds. A failed
  or moderated task refunds the whole hold - nothing to do on your side. `treg audit` and the
  dashboard's Activity page show each task's state (`generating…` → `done` / `failed · refunded`)
  with the result link once it exists.
- **Result URLs expire** (the descriptor's `ttl_note` says how soon; MiniMax's ~9h). Download
  promptly; treg never stores the media. On some routes the file needs one more call -
  `--await` prints that exact command instead of downloading.
- Responses needing settlement or task-ownership evidence are limited to 8 MiB. Larger responses
  return `502` with `detail.error=response_buffer_limit` and no charge; retrying the same oversized
  response will not help. Authorized free final downloads needing no body evidence stream in full.
  Such downloads are fetched again on retry, not retained for local idempotent replay.
- A tool whose answer inlines media (Google AI's images, speech and Lyria music arrive as base64 in the JSON) is
  exempt from the 8 MiB limit up to 64 MiB and is charged from the provider's reported usage. Its
  answer is never replayed: an `Idempotency-Key` retry generates, and bills, a new image. A
  `response_buffer_limit` whose message says it is temporary means treg is busy: retry shortly.

## Retrying a call without paying twice

If a call times out or you never see its answer, repeat it with the same `idempotency_key` (over MCP)
or `Idempotency-Key` header (over HTTP). treg returns the stored answer, does not call the provider
again, and charges nothing. The result says `replayed: true`.

Only for a genuine retry. Asking the same question again to see what changed is NEW work: use a new
key or none, or you will get the old answer back. Reusing one key for a different request is refused.
A 409 means the original call is still running: retry shortly. A 410 `idempotency_response_lost` means
it was charged but its answer was not kept: try `GET /calls/{call_id}/result`, or use a new key.
A 410 `idempotency_outcome_unknown` means its outcome was not recorded: `GET /calls/{call_id}` shows the cost; use a new key.

Most retries need none of this — a failed call was never billed.

Catalog entries marked `strict_query: true` accept only their declared query parameters, once each. Include required fields, use allowed values and omit the request body.

## Task — your own tools: call one the team registered

**Start from what is registered, then use the API exactly as its own docs say.** No treg vocabulary,
no special params:

```
treg tool ls                                  # what this team has registered
treg call intercom conversations?per_page=5   # <tool-name> + the upstream path
```

Over HTTP that is `GET https://treg.to/call/<tool-name>/<path>` with `X-Treg-Token: <your token>`. treg looks
up the named tool, injects that team's credential server-side, and relays **everything faithfully**
(method, query params, your headers, body). Your `X-Treg-Token` is stripped before the upstream sees
it. Works for GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.

Only tools this org has registered resolve. Discover them with `treg tool ls` · `treg skill ls`.

## Task — share your keys & skills so teammates' agents can use them
**Bulk (the fast path):** run it in the directory the human names. It lists the provider keys it
recognises in that `.env` and the skills in its subdirs, and registers only the ones they tick:
```bash
treg upload                       # both sides of the cwd; `treg upload env|skills --dir <d>` to restrict
```
**Default: wrap new keys in a skill.** When registering a new key/endpoint/CLI, pair it with
a skill so credential, tool, and recipe land together (and it gets a shareable page). If no
skill exists, create a basic one — a proper SKILL.md (frontmatter matters: agents discover
skills by it) + one example call:
```bash
mkdir -p ./posthog && cat > ./posthog/SKILL.md <<'MD'
---
name: posthog
description: Query the PostHog analytics API through treg — the key is injected server-side. Use for events, insights, and project queries.
---
Call it: `treg call posthog api/projects/@current` (upstream: https://us.posthog.com)
MD
treg skill init --dir ./posthog   # drafts treg.json: base_url from the catalog (folder name) or URLs in SKILL.md; review it + add the key
treg skill add --dir ./posthog    # registers recipe + secret + tool atomically
```
**Never orphan a secret:** a stored key nothing binds is dead weight — if you use `secret add`
directly, bind it to a tool (endpoint/CLI) in the same breath.
**Bare endpoint, no recipe (only when a skill adds nothing):**
```bash
treg secret add posthog-key --value "$POSTHOG_API_KEY"          # or --file ./.secret/token.json
treg tool add posthog --base-url https://us.posthog.com --secret posthog-key
# query-key API instead of a bearer header:
treg tool add serpapi --base-url https://serpapi.com --secret <name-or-id> \
  --auth-in query --auth-name api_key --auth-format '{secret}'
```
**A whole skill (recipe + secrets + tool, possibly multi-credential):**
```bash
treg skill scaffold ~/.claude/skills/google-ads --out gads.json
#   -> walks the dir: captures SKILL.md as the recipe + every .secret/* as a secret.
#   -> YOU then edit gads.json: set base_url, and complete each binding (location/name/format).
#      e.g. google-ads needs TWO bindings on one request:
#        Authorization: Bearer {access_token}  (injector: oauth)
#        developer-token: {secret}             (injector: env)
treg skill push gads.json                                        # registers the bundle atomically
```
Share it inside the org: give a teammate the endpoint + tool name and their agent can call it
**without being handed the credential** — you granted the access, treg injects the secret, and the
call is logged against their token.

**Auth shapes** (per binding `injector`, = the secret's `kind`): `env` (plain string) ·
`secret_file` (JSON token file, pull `secret_field`) · `oauth` (JSON token, auto-refreshed) ·
`cli_auth` (a token the human copied out of a CLI they are already signed into, and supplied to treg
themselves). Multiple bindings apply to every request.

**OAuth, two modes (treg keeps it fresh):** if the oauth secret carries `refresh_token` +
`client_id` + `client_secret`, treg **auto-refreshes** it before it expires (you never re-upload).
If it's just a bare token, that's **manual mode**, treg injects it as-is and you re-upload when it
expires. Same storage; a credential can graduate from manual to auto with no migration.

**Getting the first OAuth token, two ways (your choice):**
- **Manual:** do your own OAuth locally, then `treg secret add gsc --file token.json --kind oauth`.
- **Hosted connect:** `treg oauth connect gsc --client-secret client_secret.json --scopes <scope>`
  → prints a consent URL; you approve in the browser; treg captures the token directly.
  One-time setup: add `https://treg.to/oauth/callback` to your OAuth app's redirect URIs.

## Task — manage the team + monitor

An account can own up to 10 teams. Joining other teams as a member does not count toward this limit.
```bash
treg tool ls / secret ls / skill ls / calls          # inventory + audit log — scoped to the active org
treg tool rm <id> / secret rm <id> / skill rm <id>   # secret rm is blocked while a tool binds it
treg health            # status of every credential in this org (ok | invalid | unknown)
treg health --run      # re-check now: refresh oauth tokens, probe each tool, alert owners
```
**Teams / orgs** (owner > admin > member > viewer; a member manages only what they created):
```bash
treg org create "Team A"                       # you become owner (auto-active)
treg org rename --name "Team B" --slug team-b   # admin+; existing keys keep working
treg org invite bob@company.com --role member  # admin+; emails the invite (a one-time code is the fallback)
treg org members                               # admin+; who's in the active org
treg org ls / treg org switch <slug>           # your orgs / switch active
```
**Give an agent its own identity** (admin+). An agent doesn't have to borrow the human's token — mint
it one, and every call it makes is capped, scoped and logged as *itself*:
```bash
treg org agent-new customer-bot --pin customer=cust_A  # scope history and shared-provider async reads
treg org agent-new ci-bot                        # prints the token ONCE (run again to rotate)
treg org agent-new ci-bot --tools stripe,gh --cap 500   # only these tools, 500 calls/day
treg org agents                                  # who the team's agents are + today's usage
treg org agent-rm <user_id>                      # revoke instantly
```
Put that token in the agent's `TREG_TOKEN` env var. An agent token can **call this team's tools and
read** — it can never sign in, create a team, or be an owner. If you are an agent and you were given
your own token, use it instead of the machine owner's: your work then shows up under your own name in
`treg calls`.

The invitee signs in with the invited email and runs `treg accept` — no code handling needed
(the code path still works: `treg org join <code>`). A brand-new invitee also gets their own
**personal org** (no empty state), so removing them from a team never locks them out. Give a tool
a probe so treg can validate it: `health_check: {method, path, expect_status}` (e.g. intercom `{"path":"me"}`).

## Feedback

Proactively share problems and suggestions about treg. Small annoyances that slowed your task
down count too: unclear instructions, confusing results or charges, unhelpful errors, and
missing capabilities you worked around, even if the task succeeded. Describe what you needed and
observed; you do not need to prove a bug. Distinguish observations from suspected causes.
Use the `feedback` tool over MCP, or `treg feedback submit` over CLI. Pass related call IDs
in `call_ids` (CLI: `--call-id`), not only in the message; references are optional.
Report each issue once. Feedback helps the treg team improve the product; it does not complete
the user's task. Keep going afterward.
Keep private information out of the report. See [feedback instructions](https://treg.to/feedback.md).

## Review

If a call result invites a review, rate that one call after using it:
`review(call_id, usefulness, reason?)` over MCP or `treg review CALL_ID USEFULNESS [--reason "..."]`.
Choose `useful`, `partly`, `not_useful`, or `not_sure`; uncertainty is fine. One review per
invitation; a review of an uninvited call is accepted, and a team counts once per endpoint. Reasons
may be quoted on the endpoint's catalog page without naming your team: write about the endpoint, omit
private data, use `feedback` for anything confusing or wrong, then continue.

## Rules
- Secrets are **write-only** — the API never returns a stored value, to you or to anyone.
- A tool may bind a secret **a teammate shared with this org** (use-without-hold) — that's the point:
  they chose to share it, it stays scoped to the org, you can spend it without seeing it, and every
  call is attributed to the token that made it. It is delegated access inside one team, never access
  to a credential nobody granted you.
- **Everything is scoped to your active org.** A token reaches that team's tools and no one else's.
- The proxy doesn't understand the upstream; if a call fails, the status you see is the upstream's truth.
